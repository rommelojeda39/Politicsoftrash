        <div>
          <p> After my last interview with @proudastorian, a local group of volunteers who clean the streets of the neighborhood every Sunday, Kate Peterson, the founder, exclaimed that they had collected twenty bags of trash within two hours of
            hitting the streets.
            <br>
            <br>
            The number was surprising because Astoria, from what I thought I knew, was one of the cleanest neighborhoods in Queens.
            <br>
            <br>
            The problem with litter, and the reason why groups like @proudastorian have formed around the city, came after the Department of Sanitation of New York (DSNY) announced a budget cut of 106 million dollars for the fiscal year which started
            in July.

          <p> While the difference can imply a lack of service from the agency, Andrew Harris, 38, a resident of Astoria, notes that he has “seen the trash and litter problem for a long time.” Harris used to pick up trash by himself during the
            weekend so that his block would be clean, and eventually joined the @proudastorian group.
          </p>

        <h3> Its Probably About Money: </h3>
        <div>
          <p> Harris lives on 36th Ave, 11106, an area that is less frequented than other avenues of Astoria, and one that has fewer litter baskets. 36th Ave. ranks lower with an average income of $63,703, compared to $74,000 and higher of the zip
            codes around it.

            <br>
            <br>
            When Peterson sat at the virtual hearing with the Committee on Sanitation and Solid Waste Management on Sept. 24th, Acting Commissioner Greyson mentioned that the budget cuts included a 39% decrease in services of the litter basket pickup
            program. Baffled at how calm this number was mentioned, Peterson recalls asking herself <i>"how would the 39% decrease of services manifest? Would it be 39% of the cleaning days? What would this mean for a neighborhood that has a lower
              income?"</i>
            <br>

          While the DSNY Commissioner’s office did not reply at the time of publication to elaborate on how the cuts would play out in the upcoming months, Peterson’s concerns for sanitation equity, during a pandemic, resonates with most of the
          volunteers.
          <br>
          <br>
          Based on data compiled by the NYC Open Data portal, there are 23,707 public litter baskets in all of the five boroughs. This number is divided into 9459 baskets in Manhattan, 6305 in Brooklyn, 2931 in the Bronx, 4086 in Queens, and 926 in
          the borough of Staten Island. While Manhattan is a hot spot for tourists throughout the year, despite having a lower population, the number of baskets is .10 percent less than the amount in Brooklyn and Queens combined.

        <h3> What do Zip Codes Tell Us? </h3>
        <div>
          <p> Because the dispersion of public litter baskets considers the foot traffic and green spaces available, using the number of litter baskets against the income level does not give a reliable measure. However, using public recycling bins—
            which permit pedestrians to deposit their recycle cup and bottles, etc— allows us to see how these are distributed throughout the 5 boroughs.

            The map above pinpoints the locations of the recyclable bins available in all the cities, and the darker it gets, the more there are in that respective area.
            <br>
            <br>
            Based on the longitude and latitude information available in the data provided by NYC Open, the zip codes with the most number of recycling bins can be traced and matched with their average income for that area.

          <h3> What Is The takeaway? </h3>

          <div>
            <p>
              Based on this data, it is undoubtedly a fact that Manhattan has the highest average income in the five boroughs and the highest number of baskets and recycling bins in their streets per resident. Brooklyn and Queens, while these brought
              have
              a denser population, trail behind in all of the areas— the same way that the Bronx and Staten Island do relative to their population size.
